## Footshop Assignment

This is base for some microsite (small landing page) that needs to be finished by graphics designs.

Graphics designs (mobile and desktop versions) you can find in `design/` folder or you can use [Figma app](https://www.figma.com/file/92iP1T9Lj68yTdhQsrkIrr/Footshop-FE-Interview-Task) in browser. (Note: if you have Figma account, you can use Inspect feature to explore of dimensions and propeorties of elements.)

All image resources are in `public` folder.

Start with `pages/index.js` and `styles/index.scss` files.

In general you are free to make any changes you think are necessary and use any packages you want.

Please write down in Description section below what/why did you use or some your ideas to improve this page (describe in 2-5 sentences).

After you are done zip the project again and send it back.

Thank you and good luck!

## Description

I've used the mobile first method of styling. I've divided the page to five parts and than styled each part individually. If i have to improve something, I would give more time to responsiveness. Maybe add one more layer of responsiveness and define the sizes of elements in percentage.

## Getting Started
